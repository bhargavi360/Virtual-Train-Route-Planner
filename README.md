# 🚆 Virtual Train Route Planner (C++)

An interactive **train route planner** implemented in C++.  
It lets you **navigate train stations in real-time** using:

- **Doubly linked list** → forward/backward station navigation  
- **Circular linked list** → loop routes (e.g., metro-style round trips)  

---

## 🎯 Concept
The Virtual Train Route Planner demonstrates linked list usage in real-world scenarios:
- **Linear Routes**: Start-to-end station navigation  
- **Circular Routes**: Routes that loop back to the starting station  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Requirements
- **Doubly linked list** for forward/backward navigation  
- **Circular linked list** for loop routes  
- **Interactive menu** for user navigation  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Compile
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 train_route.cpp -o train_route
2. Run
bash
Copy
Edit
./train_route
🖥️ Features
✅ Create a linear or circular train route
✅ Add station names dynamically
✅ Display the full route
✅ Navigate forward and backward through stations
✅ Show the current station in real-time
✅ Looping route visualization for circular tracks
