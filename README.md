🚆 Virtual Train Route Planner (C++) 📌 Project Overview

The Virtual Train Route Planner is a simulation project that allows users to navigate train stations in real-time. It demonstrates the use of doubly linked lists (for forward/back navigation) and circular linked lists (for loop routes, like metro systems).

This project is menu-driven and allows you to create a train route, display it, and move forward/backward along the route.

⚡ Features

✅ Linear Routes using doubly linked lists

✅ Circular Routes using circular linked lists

✅ Dynamic addition of stations

✅ Forward navigation through stations

✅ Backward navigation through stations

✅ Menu-driven interface
